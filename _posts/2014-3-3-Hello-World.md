Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

teste {{ page.title }} abc

{{ site.data.teste.name }}

## teste do primeiro evento: {{site.data.eventos.first.name}}

{{site.data.@context}}

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
